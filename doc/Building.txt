This assumes you have booted either the Live CD or USB sticks, and you
have at least 12 GB of free storage space available, hopefully a little
more. The GUI interface is not strictly necessary for a successful build,
but of course it will make the wait more interesting.

The build script is (aptly) named build.sh, and is located in /root on the
live system. In the source, it is /lfs/build/JayOS/scripts/build.sh. Within
it are a few variables you may wish to change.


LFS
I would leave this one alone. No harm, no foul.

SCRATCH
This is the directory that holds the loopback filesystem mounted on /lfs.

You will need at least 12 GB available for a successful build. Feel free
to adjust the dd count values in the script for a more roomy environment.

vaio:/fs/fs# ls -l
total 12595216
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 12884901888 Jan  4 17:14 lfs.fs


If you have a 1 GB of RAM or less, you may also want to configure a swap
space at this time. SeaMonkey is known to want *tons* of RAM during it's
linking stage.


Now the system is ready to build!


It is safe to run build.sh from your home directory; it will not write
to anywhere but /lfs.  When it completes (in seconds) it will ask for
a shell source command to be run in the terminal.

After running the command, the shell prompt will change from # to $. This
means that the environment has been properly cleared and set up for
cross compilation.

Finally, run build.sh *again* to launch the automated build of LFS,
BLFS, and JLFS. Images for ISOs and USB sticks will also be built.

Total compile time is hovering around 16 hours on a core duo 1.66 Ghz
box with 2GB of RAM and 1GB swap. Time enough for several sandwiches :)
