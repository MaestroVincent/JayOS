The list package list below includes the base LinuxFromScratch system
(version 6.7), probably 85% of the development BeyondLinuxFromScratch
project (no KDE, only GNOME), and maybe a hundred or so of other Open
Source projects that I have taken a liking to over the years.

Extended package list information can also be found in the (booted)
Live CD as /var/lib/packages/allPackagesList.tbz.  Each extracted file
contains the install location and the md5sum of all files belonging to
the package the file is named after.

Choosing a package manager can be somewhat akin to choosing a religion,
so no, there is no official "package manager". Instead, the user is
encouraged to install their own-- from source, of course :)

Total count as of 20110225 is around 740.
