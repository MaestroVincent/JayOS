I have not yet developed a set of install scripts for two reasons. One,
I cannot account for all the various partition layouts a person might
have on their hard drive, and I really don't want to prompt them for
device names and such. That belongs in the realm of mature installers
such as the ones found in major distributions.

Then there's the issue of trust. If I were a new user of JayOS, being the
paranoid admin, I would not trust it to mess with my hard drive without
personally reading through the scripts. Instead, I would prefer a list
of instructions on how to do it manually.

The second reason I haven't written any scripts is that I honestly didn't
expect anyone to want to *install* JayOS :) Use it, yes, but actually
install it like an honest-to-goodness distro? I thought I was the only
person interested in using it that way, but now that at least one person
has asked me how, I've decided to provide some instructions.


* How to install JayOS to a hard drive or USB storage device

Optionally, make a backup of your master boot record. Something like this
should do the trick:

	* dd if=/dev/hda of=/tmp/hda.mbr bs=512 count=1

Format, create, or otherwise build a partition at least 650MB in size.
Create a fileystem of type vfat (what?) yes, vfat. Mount it.

	mkdosfs -F 16 ??

Copy /boot and /fs from the CD to the mounted partition. The /fs directory
is not strictly needed for booting, and some files in /boot could be
pruned, but don't worry about specifics until you have the new system up.

Copy /isolinux.cfg from the CD to /syslinux.cfg. It should contain the
following lines:

display /boot/isolinux.dpy
timeout 450
prompt 1
F1 /boot/isolinux.dp2 
F2 /boot/isolinux.dpy
default vmlinuz
label vmlinuz
kernel /boot/vmlinuz
append load_ramdisk=1 initrd=/boot/initrd.gz initrd_archive=ext2 ramdisk_size=196608 root=/dev/ram1 newvid rw


Unmount the filesystem and run syslinux against the device. The syntax
should look something like "syslinux /dev/hda". This copies boot loader
code to the master boot record on the drive, and creates /syslinux.bin.

At this point, you *could* go ahead and reboot to test, but this is a
perfect opportunity to use QEMU for that task. Plus, it gives you the
space to restore your MBR with your saved version, should something
not work right the first time. (A restore can be done with the same dd
command-- swap if= with of= and of= to if=)


* How to use QEMU for testing new builds

Assuming the (unmounted!) device name of your disk is /dev/hda, the 
following QEMU command will launch the emulator:

	* qemu -m 256 -hda /dev/hda -dummy-net

If you want to test an ISO, use a command like:

	* qemu -m 256 -cdrom -dummy-net

For using both a disk and cdrom drive, you'll need to add the -boot parm:

	BOOT CDROM
	* qemu -m 256 -boot d -hda /dev/hda -cdrom /lfs/build/jlfs-x86-src.iso

	BOOT HARD DISK
	* qemu -m 256 -boot c -hda /dev/hda -cdrom /lfs/build/jlfs-x86-src.iso



* How to install JayOS on a QEMU hard disk image


Create a 650 MB image 
	* qemu-img create -f raw /lfs/build/jlfs-x86-qemu.img 650M


Boot under QEMU from cdrom

	* qemu -m 256 -boot d -hda /lfs/build/jlfs-x86-qemu.img -cdrom /lfs/build/jlfs-x86-src.iso

	* fdisk /dev/hda under QEMU and create hda1 as a FAT partition

	* Continue with copying instructions under
	  "How to install JayOS to a hard drive or USB storage device"


Reboot under QEMU from the newly-created image

	* qemu -m 256 -boot c -hda /lfs/build/jlfs-x86-qemu.img -dummy-net
