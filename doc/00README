JayOS is a live CD distro intended for use as a more secure mobile
environment.  It integrates in-RAM filesystem encryption with plausible
deniabiliy for a system that can be difficult to alter without
rebuilding. This offers a user with a high degree of data integrity;
since all filesystems are either static or encrypted, the system is
resistant to physical attacks.

The user can choose at boot time what kind of filesystem to use and from
where it should be read. Since components can be spread over hard disks,
read-only media, and removable storage, this compounds the difficulty
of proving what is encrypted swap, what is an encrypted filesystem,
and what is simply random data.

It features a 2.6 kernel, unionfs, many network security and filesystem
tools, UML, and QEMU.  It runs great on low-end x86 hardware, too.
