Open sourced, yet darkly illuminated

IMO, one problem with many large distros, Fedora and Ubuntu included,
is they are very complex and aren't good examples for someone who wants
to create a fully-functional but stripped-down customized distro.

(I define fully-functional as having a boot loader, kernel, initial
ramdisk, linuxrc, root filesystem, and an automatic rebuild method
available for modification. By stripped down, I mean not having to not
include behemoths like X11, Gnome, KDE, OpenOffice and Mozilla :)

I know people who would like to make a specialized distro (gaming,
security, whatever), but don't want to take on the daunting task of
pulling out all the bells and whistles from a Knoppix or a Gentoo. They
don't want to start from scratch either, because that is even *more*
work. What they want is someone who has done the work already, and what
they *need* is work that is easily understood. The four above-mentioned
distros are nothing short of breath-taking, but they are put together
such that even the expert finds it difficult, if not impossible to
quickly glean their inner workings for their own project.

My approach is simple, and done in a straight-forward educational style.
Some of the things I did could have been done slicker and more efficiently
(the non-nALFS Makefile for BLFS comes to mind), but the clear advantage
is it's easy to understand and easy to modify. Plus it does what I want ;)
Things could be better, but they're Good Enough for now.

I have populated this website with bootable ISO and DVD images, source
code, patches, and enough documentation for you to get JayOS running on
your own system.
